# Hospital_Data_Analysis

As data analysts, our goal is to uncover the hidden stories within the data, and this hospital analysis did just that. Through a deep dive into the appointments, doctors, and patient records, we discovered some eye-opening patterns. We saw that some doctors were absolute appointment magnets, while others had room to fill their schedules. The data also revealed that certain medical issues consistently brought patients back, signaling areas where resources could be doubled down. Patients aged 18-35 were frequent visitors—perhaps navigating the chaotic dance between youth and adulthood? And let’s not forget our repeat visitors, showing unwavering loyalty to their doctors, proving that healthcare isn’t just about treatment, but trust. In the end, this analysis turned a simple hospital dataset into a compelling story of health, behavior, and the delicate balance of care.
